## Question

> If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII? 

### Hint

> Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.

## Solution

You can just google it up and get the answer. But there is a simple command line tool called 'ascii' that does the job.

Install ascii and run 'ascii 0x70' to get the answer.
