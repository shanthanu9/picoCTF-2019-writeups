## Question

> This [program](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/static/884e03d84d1888395564a0f871bb2c69/vuln) executes any shellcode that you give it. Can you spawn a shell and use that to read the flag.txt?

### Hint

>  You might be able to find some good shellcode online.

## Solution

I used this shellcode: [http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-73.php](http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-73.php)

Got it as a first search result from Google.

To inject the shellcode into the program, I ran the below command
```bash
$ printf <shellcode> | ./vuln
```
