## Question

> There is a secure website running at https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/4161/ ([link](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/4161/)) or [http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:4161](http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:4161). Try to see if you can login as admin!

### Hint

> Seems like the password is encrypted.

## Solution

This is a follow-up to `Irish-Name-Repo 1` and `Irish Name Repo 2` which were both based on SQL injections.

Here we are only asked for password. With `debug=1` (refer `Irish-Name-Repo 1`) set, we see the SQL statement looks like:
```sql
SELECT * FROM admin where password = '<input>'
```

So we can bypass it as the first challenge in this series? Let's try that
```
password: ' or 1 == 1;--
```

We get the output, 
```
SELECT * FROM admin where password = '' be 1 == 1;--'
```

What? How did `or` become `be`? As the hint suggests, there may be some encrypting. Playing around with different values of password, we realise that it's basically an encoding where each letter is replaced with another letter.

I just entered all alphabets and found out what gives 'o' and 'r' ('b' and 'e').

Later on I found out that it's just a rot13 encoding!

So the password should be
```sql
password: ' be 1 == 1;--
```
