## Question

> The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as logon and find what they've been looking at? https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/37907/ ([link](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/37907/)) or [http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:37907](http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:37907)

### Hint

> Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for {{name}}'s?

## Solution

For any username and password, the page redirects to the same page, logged in but no flag. So it doesn't seem like the server is doing any checking.

To explore more, let's look at network tab in firefox debug tools. When you submit, the page is redirected to /flag. But also observe that one of the response headers sends a 'admin=False' Set-Cookie. 

So just edit the cookie for admin to have value True (This can be done in the Storage tab) and refresh the logged in page, and there's the flag!
