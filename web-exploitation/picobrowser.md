> This website can be rendered only by picobrowser, go and catch the flag! https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/12255/ ([link](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/12255/)) or (http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:12255)[http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:12255]

### Hint

> You dont need to download a new web browser

## Solution

Indeed there is no such thing as a picobrowser. We have to trick the server to think we are using picobrowser. But that begs the question, how does the server even know what browser we are using?

If we look closely at the User-Agent header in the HTTP request message, you will see your web-browser there! So we just have to replace that we picobrower and get the Flag! I used Postman to send the HTTP request.
