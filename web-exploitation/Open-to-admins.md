# Open-to-admins

Points: 200

## Question

> This secure website allows users to access the flag only if they are admin and if the time is exactly 1400. https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/45127/ ([link](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/45127/)) or [http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:45127](http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:45127)

### Hint

> Can cookies help you to get the flag?

## Solution

When you click on the 'Flag' button, you see 'you are not an admin or not correct time'. Also based on the hint, it appears to have something to do with cookies.

So let's send a HTTP request with Cookie values. I use postman to send HTTP requests. 

Send HTTP request to /flag with 'Cookie: admin=True;time=1400' and we get the FLAG!
