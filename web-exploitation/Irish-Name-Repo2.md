## Question

> There is a website running at https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/57973/ ([link](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/57973/)). Someone has bypassed the login before, and now it's being strengthened. Try to see if you can still login! or [http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:57973](http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:57973)

### Hint

> The password is being filtered.

## Solution

This is a follow up to 'Irish-Name-Repo 1' which had a SQL injection vulnerability. If you try out the same solution, you get a page called SQLi detected. Interesting...

Now the question is how are they detecting this. With a bit of trial and error, we can see that if our input starts with `'` and contains an `or`, we get the SQLi error page. 

Okay so how do we bypass this? There is an interesting technique to do this. From debug=1 (mentioned in Irish-Name-Repo1), we see the SQL statement is the same as the previous one. So we just have to bypass the filter being used.

```
username: admin';--
password: (empty)
```

The SQL query is:
```mysql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin';--' AND password=''
```

`--` is comment symbol in SQL. So it will basically comment out the rest of the query and return the admin credentials!
