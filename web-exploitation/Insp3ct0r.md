## Question

> Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: [https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/21519/](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/21519/]) ([link](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/21519/])) or [http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:21519](http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:21519)

### Hint

> How do you inspect web code on a browser?
> There's 3 parts

## Solution

The solution will be for FireFox. The stuff I do below can be analogously done in other browsers.

You can open the Inspector by typing out Ctrl+Shift+C (or by right clicking on the page and clicking on 'Inspect Element'.

In the 'Inspector' section (as shown in the top left of the dialog box), you will see the HTML page. Look through it to find a comment with the first out of 3 parts of the flag.

Based on the hint under 'How' button on the website, we can guess that the other two flags are in the CSS and JS file.

To complete the challenge, click on the 'Style Editor' to get all the CSS files used by the web page. Click on 'my.css' and find a comment with 2nd part of the flag.

The last part of the flag can be found in the JS file, found under 'Debugger' section. Find a file called 'my.js' here and get the last part of the flag!
