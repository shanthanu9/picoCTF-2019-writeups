### Hint

> What is obfuscation?

## Solution

Here from question title, the password is checked on the client side. When you search for js code in the source, you find a very long line of 'obfuscated' js code.

Put this line into any online js deobfuscator. You should see a indented and nicer version, but the code itself may seem still hard to read. But we don't need to go over the code!

Have a close look at the array of strings on the first line. You can pieces of flags there. All you need to is take relevant pieces and join them into a flag (making semantic sense).
